# CSS-to-GLSL
This is a basic template I'm using to style data from CSS directly to a .glsl shader nested in the webpage.
Please make sure you have Three.js installed.

### Once pulled:
- Use Parcel or Vite to localy build index.html.
- Try changing the CSS vars under ‘MAIN CSS VARS FOR UPDATE:‘ comment (Colors, etc.).
- Save and refresh the page to see the results (no need to rebuild).

### This can also be accessed on Codepen:
https://codepen.io/avinvadas/pen/PoLNBJr
- Fork the pen
- Try changing the CSS vars under ‘MAIN CSS VARS FOR UPDATE:‘ comment (Colors, etc.)
- Save your pen and refresh page to see changes.
